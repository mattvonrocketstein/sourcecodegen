Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides a module-level source-code generator which
        operates on the AST from the built-in ``compiler.ast`` module.
        
        Note that this AST is not compatible with the new ``ast`` module in
        Python 2.6.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The generator works on AST parse trees.
        
        >>> from compiler import parse
        >>> tree = parse("""\
        ...     print 'Hello, world!'
        ... """)
        
        We can now generate Python-code equivalent to the original using the
        source-code generator.
        
        >>> from sourcecodegen import ModuleSourceCodeGenerator
        >>> generator = ModuleSourceCodeGenerator(tree)
        >>> print generator.getSourceCode()
        print 'Hello, world!'

        - Fixed issue where a module docstring would cause an undesired
        indentaion. [malthe]
        
        0.6.4 (released 24/01/2009)
        
        - Added convenience method to generate code. [malthe]
        
        0.6.3 (released 18/12/2008)

        0.6 (released 13/12/2008)
        
        - Operator precedence is now taken into account such that we can
        avoid unnecessary use of parentheses. This is done not only for
        aesthetic reasons, but more importantly to avoid running into
        parser errors due to Python's nesting limitation. [malthe]
        
        0.5 (released 28/11/2008)
        
        - Added `yield` and unary operators. [malthe]
        
        0.4 (released 28/11/2008)
        
        - Make sure all binary operators get parentheses around them; we may
        be able to improve upon this in the future (for
        legibility-reasons). [malthe]
        
        0.3 (released 27/11/2008)
        
        - Added logical operators. [malthe]
